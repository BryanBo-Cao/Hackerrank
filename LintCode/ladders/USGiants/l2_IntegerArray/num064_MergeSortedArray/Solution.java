Merge Sorted Array

Description
Notes
Testcase
Judge
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Notice

You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
A = [1, 2, 3, empty, empty], B = [4, 5]

After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
