Binary Tree Serialization

 Description
 Notes
 Testcase
 Judge
Design an algorithm and write code to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Writing the tree to a file is called 'serialization' and reading back from the file to reconstruct the exact same binary tree is 'deserialization'.

There is no limit of how you deserialize or serialize a binary tree, you only need to make sure you can serialize a binary tree to a string and deserialize this string to the original structure.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
An example of testdata: Binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}, denote the following structure:

  3
 / \
9  20
  /  \
 15   7
Our data serialization use bfs traversal. This is just for when you got wrong answer and want to debug the input.

You can use other method to do serializaiton and deserialization.
